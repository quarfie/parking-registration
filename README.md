# parking-registration

I created this app so I wouldn't have to use the visitor parking registration portal for my building. It uses the official site's API under the hood, proxied through a Node server I set up to bypass CORS restrictions.

## TO DO

- Profile update page (name/email/phone/PIN)
- Forgot PIN
- If profile is incomplete, require update before registration.
- About the app
